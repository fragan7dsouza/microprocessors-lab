# ⚙️ Microprocessors and Embedded Systems Lab

This repository contains 8086 assembly language programs written for the Microprocessors and Embedded Systems Laboratory. Each `.ASM` file corresponds to a specific lab experiment.

## 📂 File Structure

- `A1.ASM`
- `A2.ASM`
- `A3.ASM`
- `A4.ASM`
- `A5.ASM`
- `A6.ASM`
- `A7.ASM`
- `A8.ASM`

## 💻 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fragan7dsouza/microprocessors-lab.git
   ```
2. Use an 8086 emulator like **EMU8086** or **DOSBox** to open and run `.ASM` files
3. Assemble and execute the files using your tool's interface

> ⚠️ Make sure the emulator supports `.ASM` files and the syntax used is compatible with Intel 8086 assembly.
